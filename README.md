Insurance Cost Prediction – Machine Learning Regression Models
This project predicts insurance charges based on customer attributes using multiple regression models. It compares the performance of Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression (RFR), Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR), and Support Vector Regression (SVR).

📂 Dataset
The dataset used is insurance.csv, which contains the following columns:

age – Age of the policyholder

sex – Gender of the policyholder

bmi – Body Mass Index

children – Number of children/dependents

smoker – Whether the policyholder is a smoker

region – Residential area of the policyholder

charges – Medical insurance cost (Target variable)

🚀 Features of the Project
✅ Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Seaborn and Matplotlib
✅ Encoding of categorical variables
✅ Splitting dataset into Train/Test sets
✅ Model Training with:
    Decision Tree Regression
    Random Forest Regression
    Gradient Boosting Regression
    Support Vector Regression
✅ Model Evaluation using metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² score

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
